# Default Map Style of [Galileo](https://galileo-app.com)

Syntax of this file is based on [MapCSS file format](http://mapcss.org), with some unique features and some limitations.

There is no documentation about our branch of MapCSS (TBD), just read the comments inside the style and look for similar cases as examples.

## How to use

To force application to use your map style just put Style.mapcss file [to File Sharing folder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301) of the Galileo and relaunch the app. Only map style is loaded and custom resources is not supported yet.
